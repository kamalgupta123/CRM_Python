APIGEE Filled Requirement Sheet : PDx Big Rock API requirement ODPDaaS-APIGEE_Requirement_Sheet.xlsx

Schemas/Tables/views used : biosapeu_fr.vbep and biosapeu_fr.vbap from ETL Innovation are migrated/data shared into  hdl_pdx_sem_view.isc_self_ah_orders_api_f_v in report alpha cluster for API development.

So, Table to be used in report alpha cluster for API development is:

from 
    hdl_pdx_sem_view.isc_self_ah_orders_api_f_v
    -- API Params here
    where production_date BETWEEN TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'YYYYMMDD') AND TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '7' DAY, 'YYYYMMDD') --start/end date in YYYYMMDD format
    and material in ('1186529'); -- list of SKUs - multiple entries possible

been filled out and the API request approved via the DaaS administration portal
“BE admin”.
