Raised GitHUB Repository access for HI Radius Batch Extract 
 
Steps to raise GITHUB Repo Access: 

raise manual ritm request: Pulse Manual RITM 

application name for manual ritm : @odp cicd dev team 

raise workflow request : https://app.sc.ge.com/workflows/initiate/914536 
 
raise email for access to cicd team for repo access : email id : health_odp_cicd_dev_team@ge.com

How to Develop the Batch Extracts after taking all the above accesses					 

As the project is already created first clone the repository in your local using git clone command, and you can check the project code in the visual studio code after it. 
 
Picture 

Now pick the Batch Extract SQL Queries one by one from 6 Requirement Templates Shared  at the start of this document and test those SQL queries in DBeaver. 
 
 
Picture 
if the SQL queries run successfully in DBeaver and return response then go ahead and add these batch extract in code present in visual studio code. 

 

In visual studio code in terminal type following commands: 
git fetch origin – to get latest code from remote server 

git reset –hard origin/dev -- for innovation/nprod 

git reset –hard origin/master --- for production/prod 

 

These two commands will get latest code from remote server 

 

Now, to add your changes create a new branch and add your changes there which you can merge later using Pull Request to integrate your new branch code in dev/production. 
 
for dev the new branch name to create for pull request: minor_myinstall from dev branch checkout 

For prod the new branch name to create for pull request : major_myinstall from master branch checkout 
 
Now start making modifications in code. 

 

In code, go to config_2.json in Config folder in DynamoDB folder and add JSON for each Batch Extract. 
 
Copy old json already present and paste it at end for new batch extract and modify the following in JSON at end for new batch Extract : 
 
Base SK : Extract Name 
Prefix: S3_bucketname/foldername_inside_bucket 
Retention days: 90 as per requirement 

Compression: na 

Query_0: Contains SQL query 
Archival_Flag : Y to put file in glacier archive 

Extract_suffix : to add timestamp in extract name use value as extract_name_YYYY_MM_DD 

Extract Name : Extract Name 

 

Now copy old glue config folder files of old batch extract paste in same folder rename file with new batch extract name 

Replace batch extract name everywhere inside file 
Environment name should be nprod in development 

And prod in production 

 

Now copy old step function config files and paste in same folder rename file with new batch extract name 
Also inside the Step function config file put new extract name 

And also update new glue job name of respective batch extract in step function config file jobname key value. 

 

Now save the files use below commands in VSCode Terminal 

Git status 

Git add . 

Git commit –m “Added Batch Extracts” 

Git push origin minor_myinstall/major_myinstall 

 

Now go to github repo create a pull request and merge with dev/master as per requirement or environment working on. 

After pull request merges test step function in AWS after you receive CI/CD email. 

 
NOTE: Change in code in PROD environment in glue script or anywhere is instead of NPROD it will be PROD so, replace NPROD with PROD
